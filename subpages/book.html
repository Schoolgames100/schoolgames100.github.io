            <p>This is a book about a mysterious mythology named Solfurous Mythology. The story itself is about a 12-year-old boy named Zach and his 13-year-old cousin Emily. These to are "the chosen ones" since they are born from a magical bloodline and powerful ancestors. They must stop the evil dark wizard named the "evil old man" from destroying the earth by bringing back the most fierce monsters and villains from the afterlife. On their journey, they will have to practice a lot and face many conflicts, but the prophecy says they will eventually defeat the evil dark wizard. No one knows what will happen to this two, but if you would like to figure out, I would recommend getting the book and following Zach and Emily's first journey.</p>
